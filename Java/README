You must have javac and jar in your path
to compile JAVA programs. If you don't the
compiles will fail. Examine the build.sh file
in this directory, and modify the variable
$JAVABINPATH. This variable is only important
for the compilation process.

# I

Change in to the same directory that this README
is in and run ./build.sh
This should produce 2 .jar files

lglview.jar - The 2D viewer to look at layouts

imageMaker.jar - Generates high resolution images
of layouts. Run without arguments to get the
usage. This program is very crude, and will
probably be expanded as soon as time permits.
The source code is there so feel free to dive
in!

Numerous warnings will be produced, but it should
compile.
