![Image of the Internet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flindeberg/LGL/master/resources/images/internet_2016.png)

An example of the Internet as generated by data from 2016. The grapher can in theory handle any kind of data in ncol-format.

# Requirements

A heap of stuff, in no particular order:

- A C++ compiler
- - Boost library required (I should have fixed version issues, but I have not future proofed it)
- bgpdump (https://bitbucket.org/ripencc/bgpdump/wiki/Home)
- perl (5+, I think)
- Java (8 seems to work)
- Xserver installed for graphical tools (works well under WSL 2 in Windows)
- Python 3 (there are bash scripts lying around as well, but the python scripts are 3x faster)

# Installation


## Compling LGL C++ components

    `setup.pl -i` script which does a lot of suspect lifting).


This will compile 2D and 3D versions of LGL and put the resulting binaries 
in the ./bin directory. Afterwards you can move them whereever you want.


NOTE:  setup.pl has been updated to locate boost, however you may need
       to direct gcc on where to find the includes if the automated 
       detection does not work:

       env CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local/include ./setup.pl -i


## Comple Java jar files 

Use the gmake Makefile, i.e. 

    prompt$ make 
    prompt$ make install # local install in $(PROJECTDIR)/bin


You must have the following Perl modules in your @INC path to run LGL:

    ParseConfigFile.pm
    LGLFormatHandler.pm

These files are in the ./perls directory.  You don't have to know anything 
about these modules, and you won't have to use them directly but lgl.pl will 
call them.

https://www.noction.com/blog/as-path-and-as-path-prepending


After all is compiled and done you can run LGL by the driver script lgl.pl as:

    prompt$ ./bin/lgl.pl edges_file

but you have to modify the 'tmpdir' variable in lgl.pl. That directory will 
hold all the files that LGL outputs, and it must be changed for EACH run.  
However, The best way to run LGL is to have setup.pl generate a sample 
config file for lgl.pl by running it as

    prompt$ ./setup.pl -c conf_file_name

That file (after modification of course) can just be given to lgl.pl for 
execution as follows:

    prompt$ ./bin/lgl.pl -c conf_file_name

The config file itself is documented further, and explains each of the 
variables to be used.  It also provides defaults, so the minimum that MUST 
be changed are the variables:

    tmpdir
    inputfile

where tmpdir is the output directory of the LGL run and inputfile is the edge 
file. inputfile must be a file parsable by LGLFormatHandler.pm This can be 
just a simple 2 column space delimited file with one edge per line 
(the 2 vertex ids represent the two columns).

One last change is to ./bin/lgl.pl. A Perl variable $LGLDIR must be set to 
the root bin directory of all the lgl executables (This might be 
/where/lgl/was/unpacked/bin ). This var is empty by default, and the 
program won't run until it is set correctly.


# Other files that come with LGL

A list of important files in the perls dir:

    genVrml.pl - This generates the VRML code from 3D layout results. Run 
    genVrml.pl with no args to get the usage.

colorEdgesBasedOnLevel.pl - This generates a simple color file to be 
given to lglview, that will color your edges based on the level in the 
heirarchy in layout.

Other files might be included as well, but they are not necessary for LGL. 
Their documentation will be added here in the near future, or they may not 
be carried in the future.


## lglayout2D

Usage: ./lgl-exparmental-label/bin/lglayout2D [-x InitPositionFile] [-a AnchorsFile]
        [-t ThreadCount] [-m InitMassFile] [-i IterationMax] 
        [-s] [-r nbhdRadius] [-T timeStep] [-S nodeSizeRadius]
        [-k casualSpringConstant] [-s specialSpringConstant]
        [-e] [-l] [-y] [-q EQ Distance] [-u placementDistance]
        [-E ellipseFactors] [-v placementRadius] [-L] nodeFile.lgl


        -[mx]    A file that has the node id followed by
                the initial values.

            -t      The number of threads to spawn.
                    This is capped by the processor count.
    
            -i      The maximum number of iterations.
    
            -r      The neighborhood radius for each particle. It
                    defines the interaction range for casual (generally
                    repulsive) interactions

            -T      The time step for each iteration

            -S      The 'radius' of each node.

            -M      The 'mass' of each node.

            -R      The radius of the outer perim.

            -W      The write interval.

            -z      Root node you want to use.

            -l      Write out the edge level map.

            -e      Output the mst used.

            -O      Use original weights.

            -y      Layout the tree only.

            -I      Don't show layout progress, be quiet (kinda)

            -q      Equilibrium distance.

            -E      Ellipse factors. (Force the layout to be more of an ellipse -E 1x1.2) 

            -u      Placement distance is the distance you want
                    the next level to be placed with respect to
                    the previous level. If this float value is not
                    given a formula calculates the placement distance.

            -v      Placement radius is a measure of the placement density

            -L      Place the leafs close by. This applies to trees more than
                    graphs. Setting this option will place the child vertices very
                    near the parent vertex if all of its children have none themselves.

            -o      Read a previously created coordinates file to start processing level processing. This technique is used for animations. 



## ImageMaker
### A JAVA 2D image output tool. 

Generating Static Images using LGLLib.jar 

Runtime Example:

    java -Djava.awt.headless=true -Xmx20000m -Xms20000m -cp ./LGL-Master/Java/jar/LGLLib.jar ImageMaker.GenerateImages <height> <width> run.lgl run.coords -c run.colors -s 0.01 -l run.labels


## LGLView 
### A JAVA 2D viewer for looking and reviewing .lgl, .coord, .color, and .label files. 

coordinates use lglview.jar 

    java -Xmx2G -Xms2G -cp ./LGL-master/Java/jar/LGLLib.jar Viewer2D.Viewer2D


Looking at the huge PNG (100k x 100k pixels) java.awt.image.Raster: The 
maximum width x height has to be less than Integer.MAX_VALUE (2147483647) so 
the maximum square image is 46340 x 46340. Note also that such images will 
need a lot of RAM since Java's BufferedImage's pixels are hold in memory. 

An example of a larger output would be: 

    java  -Xms1G -Xmx5G -jar ImageMaker.jar 29200 29200 <files...>

    LGLView.jar - The full package that combines LGLView and ImageMaker.

# File Formats:
(Thank you to Claire McWhite for this tutorial) 

## Input format (.lgl)

The input format to LGL is called .ncol, which is just a space separated list of two connected nodes with an optional third column of weight.

    $ cat example.lgl
    node1 node2 [optional weight]
    Key points for formatting the input .ncol

    Each line must be unique
    A node may connect to many other nodes
    A node cannot connect to itself
    If a line is B-A, there cannot also be a line A-B
    There can’t be blank lines
    There can’t be blanks in any column
    No header line
    node1 node2
    node1 node3 # OK
    node1 node2 # Will cause error
    node1 node1 # Will cause error
    node2 node1 # Will cause error
    node3         # Will cause error
              # Trailing blank line will cause error

## Coloring format (.colors)

LGL allows you to color both nodes and edges. In order to color edges, each pairwise edge must have an R G B value. To color individual nodes, each node must have an R G B value. RGB values must be scaled to one 1, so just divide each number of an RGB value by 255. The rules for formatting an .ncol file apply here too, i.e. no blanks, no empty lines, no redundancy, etc.

    $ cat example.edge.colors
    node1 node2 1.0 0.5 0.0 
    node3 node4 0.0 1.0 0.8 
    node5 node6 0.1 0.1 1.0

    $ cat example.vertex.colors
    node1 1.0 0.8 0.0 
    node2 1.0 0.5 0.0 
    node3 0.2 0.1 0.8
    node4 0.0 1.0 0.8 
    node5 0.6 0.5 0.5
    node6 0.1 0.1 1.0


## The new labels file format (.labels)

The flat file will have single line entries for the configuration of each label with a \n at the end.

Pixel sizes cannot be in decimal or fractions 

Colors will be referenced by their hex values. #000000-#111111

    nodename,
    	(name of the node we want to center the shape around)	
    shape,
    	(name of shape: circle or square)
    shape_size,
    	(size of the shape in pixels from center to edge?)
    shape_border_with,
    	(width of the shape in px)
    shape_border_color,
    	(color used for the shape border)
    shape_fill_color,
    	(color used to fill the shape)
    shape_fill_opacity,
    	(opacity for the fill of the shape)
    line_size,
    	(width of line in px)
    line_length,
    	(length of line in px)
    line_angle,
    	(direction of the line off the shape edge)
    line_color,
    	(color of the line off the shape)
    top_text_ttf,
    	(filename for ttf font)
    top_text_size,
     	(text size)
    top_text_color,
     	(text color for upper text)
    top_bg_fill_color 
    	(color used for text background)
    bottom_text_ttf,
    	(filename for ttf font)
    bottom_text_size,
     	(text size)
    bottom_text_color,
    	(text color for upper text)
    bottom_bg_fill_color
    	(color used for text background)
    top_text
    	(text string for top label)
    Bottom_text
    	(text string for bottom label)


Example of a label in the input config file:


    174,circle,20,2,000000,000000,100,5,25,30,000000,file.ttf,25,FFFFFF,000000,file.ttf,50,FFFFFF,000000,COGENT COMMUNICATIONS,GLOBAL NETWORK
    5413,circle,20,2,000000,00FF00,20,5,125,100,000000,C:\Program Files\Wondershare\Wondershare Filmora (CPC)\Fonts\ARIALUNI.TTF,30,FF0000,000000,C:\Program Files\Wondershare\Wondershare Filmora (CPC)\Fonts\ARIALUNI.TTF,30,FFFFFF,000000,COGENT COMMUNICATIONS,GLOBAL NETWORK


Command line example:

    java -Djava.awt.headless=true -Xmx20000m -Xms20000m -cp ./LGL-master/Java/jar/LGLLib.jar ImageMaker.GenerateImages 5000 5000 <file.lgl> <file.coords> -c <file.colors> -l <file.labels> -s <scale ex: 0.1>



# An LGL workflow

This is any example to make a network with colored nodes and edges. I would begin by making a file of all pairwise edges and their associated traits. It can be difficult to keep .ncol and .color files in sync, and so it will cause fewest headaches to begin with one file containing all the information to create both.

    $ echo "Nodes and traits"
    $ cat homology.txt
    node1 node2 source score rank species1 species2
    protein1 protein2 blastp 150 1 mouse human
    protein3 protein4 blastp 50 2 wheat rat
    protein2 protein5 hmmscan 60 3 human human
    Then take the first two columns (minus the header) to create an .ncol file. This is the file used to layout the graph

    $ echo "Get node columns, remove header"
    $ awk '{print $1, $2}' homology.txt  | awk '{if(NR>1)print}' > homology.ncol
    $ cat homology.ncol
    protein1 protein2
    protein3 protein4
    protein2 protein5

Then choose a trait, and create a edge.colors file. I generally select the first two columns, and a trait to color by, then just use sed to replace the trait values with the RGB value I want to color that type of edge by.

In this file, we want to color all edges predicted with the algorithm hmmscan red, and all edges found with blastp blue.

    $ echo "Get node columns and trait column"
    $ awk '{print $1, $2, $3}' homology.txt  | awk '{if(NR>1)print}' >  homology_alg.colors.tmp

    $ echo "Replace hmmscan trait with RGB value
    $ sed -i 's/hmmscan/0 1 0/g' homology_alg.colors.tmp

    $ echo "Replace blastp trait with RGB value
    $ sed 's/blastp/0 0 0/g' homology_alg.colors.tmp > homology_algorithm.edge.colors

    $ cat homology_algorithm.edge.colors
    protein1 protein2 0 0 0
    protein3 protein4 0 0 0 
    protein2 protein5 0 1 0

We could also color each node by some trait. In this file format, each vertex must have an associated RGB value. In this case, we want to color every human protein red, and proteins from every other species blue.

    $ echo "Get first column of nodes and species"
    $ awk '{print $1, $6}' homology.txt  | awk '{if(NR>1)print}'> vertex1_species.tmp

    $ Get second column of nodes and species"
    $ awk '{print $2, $7}' homology.txt  | awk '{if(NR>1)print}'> vertex2_species.tmp

    $ Get unique nodes"
    $ cat vertex1_species.tmp vertex2_species.tmp | sort -u > homology_human.vertex.colors.tmp

    $ Color human nodes red"
    $ sed -i 's/human/1 0 0/' homology_human.vertex.colors.tmp

    $ Color any other node blue" 
    $ sed 's/mouse\|wheat\|rat/0 0 1/' homology_human.vertex.colors.tmp > homology_human.vertex.colors

    $ cat homology.human.vertex.colors
    protein1 0 0 1
    protein3 0 0 1
    protein2 1 0 0
    protein4 0 0 1
    protein5 1 0 0 
    Running


# Pre-seeding animation technique 

The Opte Project was able to use lglayout2D to create a full animation in 10k using this new pre-seeding technique:

    ./LGL-master/bin/lglayout2D -D -t 56 -x <filename for the previous frame coords file> -o <run.coords> -E1x1.2 run.lgl

LGL will read the previous file and start with those coordinates rather than starting from scratch. This technique allows nodes to stay in nearly the same place creating another frame generated from the previous.


# Expanding LGL

The most obvious way to expand LGL is to add support for your type of edge file to LGLFormatHandler.pm.  Just add a method to read in your file type, update 
the 'loadFromFile' method to recognize your file suffix, and that should be it.


# Making Internet graphs

If your intention is to graph custom stuff, just hack away. Below is how you quite easily
can make graphs from bgp-dumps. You need a separate folder for each project, due to design
in the original LGL library. Below follows an example for a graph for a 2000 Internet. Takes 
around 10 minutes on a fairly modern computer (8 threads or so) with a decent Internet connection. 

The oneliner which creates a graph, including bootstrapping, from 2000-09-01:
    
    prompt$ cd scripts/
    prompt$ ./creategraphfromdate.sh 2000 09
    prompt$ # doing magic, and creating a graph
    prompt$ # arguments to creategraphfromdate are year and month
    prompt$ # and the scipt lacks proper error handling

The same thing but step by step (if above fails):

    prompt$ cd scripts/
    prompt$ ./create_run.sh internet_2000
    prompt$ cd ../testrun/internet_2000
    prompt$ wget http://data.ris.ripe.net/rrc00/2000.09/bview.20000901.0610.gz
    prompt$ ./bootstrap.sh bview.20000901.0610.gz
    prompt$ # doing magic, and creating a graph
    prompt$ # by default generating a 2400x2400 png (change run.sh for different resolution)
    prompt$ # should be a 'internet_2001.png' in 'testrun/internet_2001' if all went well
    
 Also possible:
 
    prompt$ cd scripts/
    prompt$ ./creategraphfromurl.sh http://data.ris.ripe.net/rrc00/2000.09/bview.20000901.0610.gz
    prompt$ # wait for magic, by default generating a 2400x2400 png (change run.sh for different resolution)
    prompt$ # should be a 'view.20000901.0610.png' in 'testrun/bview.20000901.0610' if all went well
 
Replace the bview-file with a more recent one for a larger and newer network network. Coloring is
set in `perls/colorEdgesBasedOnLevel.pl`, currently a mix of greenish and bluish tints going on white
at the edges. 

A short disclaimer; the graph is only as good as your data. The `bootstrap` script works for generating interesting graphs. Are they 100% correct? I don't know, you are welcome to check and improve the code! There might be BGP-quirks I do not know of, even though I catch the vast majority of bgp announcements.
